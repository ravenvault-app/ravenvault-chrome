**RavenVault Chrome Extension**

Last updated: January 19, 2026

## The Short Version

RavenVault does not collect, store, or send your data anywhere. Everything stays on your computer.

## What Happens When You Use RavenVault

When you export a conversation from Poe.com:

1. The extension reads the conversation from the page
2. It sends the content to the RavenVault app on your Mac
3. The app saves it as a file in your Obsidian folder

That's it. No cloud. No servers. No tracking. Just your conversations saved to your own computer.

## What We Don't Do

- We don't collect your conversations
- We don't track how you use the extension
- We don't use analytics
- We don't sell or share any data (we don't have any)

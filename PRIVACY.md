## Data Collection

RavenVault does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. 

## How It Works

- Chat content is captured from your browser and processed entirely on your local machine
- Exported files are saved directly to your local Obsidian vault
- No data is sent to RavenVault developers or any third parties

## Local Processing Only

All communication occurs between the browser extension, the desktop app, and the Obsidian plugin—all running locally on your computer. Your conversations never leave your device.

# RavenVault Chrome Extension

[![Chrome Web Store](https://img.shields.io/chrome-web-store/v/jjcpdcmcellmiaagaihhbgohaidfpmkp)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ravenvault/jjcpdcmcellmiaagaihhbgohaidfpmkp)

RavenVault is a Chrome extension that exports Poe.com AI conversations to your local Obsidian vault as clean Markdown files. It works in conjunction with the [RavenVault macOS app](https://ravenvault.app/)—the extension captures content from your browser while the app handles conversion and storage. Without the companion app running, exports cannot complete.

## Installation

**[Install from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ravenvault/jjcpdcmcellmiaagaihhbgohaidfpmkp)**

This repository contains the complete source code for the Chrome extension. We've open-sourced it so you can audit exactly what runs in your browser and verify that your data stays on your machine.

## Privacy & Security

This extension is designed with privacy as a core principle.

**All communication stays on your machine.** The extension connects only to a local WebSocket server (localhost/127.0.0.1) running on your computer as part of the RavenVault macOS app. No data is sent to any external servers.

**No background data collection.** The extension activates only when you click its icon on a Poe.com page. It does not monitor your browsing, collect analytics, or phone home.

**Minimal permissions.** The extension requests only the permissions necessary to function (see below).

**Fully auditable.** This repository contains the complete, unobfuscated source code. The published Chrome Web Store version is built directly from this source with no additional transformations.

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests these permissions in `manifest.json`:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| `activeTab` | To access the current Poe.com page when you click the extension icon |
| `scripting` | To inject the content script that captures the page and displays status UI |
| `tabs` | To detect when you navigate away from or close a tab during export |
| Host permission: `poe.com` | To run on Poe.com chat pages |
| Host permission: `poecdn.net` | To download images and attachments from Poe's CDN |
| Host permission: `localhost` | To communicate with the RavenVault macOS app on your machine |
| `externally_connectable`: `ravenvault.app` | Allows the RavenVault onboarding page to detect when the extension is installed and complete setup automatically |

The extension does not request permissions for browsing history, bookmarks, downloads, or any other sensitive browser data.

## How It Works

When you click the extension icon, it connects to the locally-running macOS app via WebSocket. The app coordinates the export by sending commands to scroll through and capture the conversation. The extension captures page content, including messages, code blocks, tables, and images, and fetches any media assets. All processing and file storage happens in the macOS app on your machine.
